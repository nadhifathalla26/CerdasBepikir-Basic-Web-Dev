# CerdasBepikir-Web-Dev
This project is my submission for Dicoding Basic Web Programming Course. I use media queries to customize layouts on various device screen sizes.

Here are the criterias:
1. There are header, footer, main, article, and aside elements in the HTML file.
2. Each element must contain content that is designated according to the element (applying semantic HTML concepts in compiling the website structure). For example: Header contains title and navigation. While the article content may not be in the Header.
3. Must display personal identity (personal biodata) which at least must contain a real photo of yourself and a name according to Dicoding's profile. Self-identity must be displayed in the element.
4. Arrange layout using float or flexbox.
